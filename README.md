# Music Generator

This project allows you to train a neural network for generating MIDI music files using a single instrument.

## Install

* Python 
* Installing the following packages using pip:
	* h5py
	* Pygane	 
	* Keras
	* Tensorflow
	* Music21
	  
	

## Train the model

E.g.

```
python3 lstm.py
```

The network will use every MIDI file in `./songs` to train. Ensure each MIDI file contains only a single instrument for optimal training.

## Generating music

Once trained, generate music using **generate.py**.

E.g.

```
python3 generate.py
```

 ##  Play sound using Timidity

```
 sudo apt-get install timidity
```
 
cd songs
timidity <name of song>.mid
